# DocuSign-Project
## About
This is a hackathon project developed as a submission for DocuSign Good Code Hackathon. The project aims to provide an interactive web application for NGOs to manage their incoming donations and volunteering sign-ups.

## Tentative Design
Using DocuSign's APIs:
  - eSignature API: Requesting eSignatures, automating forms, and tracking documents.
  - ID Evidence API: Using ID Verification (IDV) to retrieve the stored data while verifying a signerâ€™s ID.
